# Student-s-Mental-Health
### Overview
This repository contains an analysis of a dataset that explores various factors affecting the well-being of students. The dataset includes demographic information, mental health indicators, and social factors. In this analysis, we specifically focus on students categorized under the "Inter" domain and examine how their well-being scores are influenced by the length of their stay.
### Dataset
The dataset contains the following key columns:
- inter_dom: Domain of the student (e.g., 'Inter').
- stay: Length of stay (e.g., Long, Short).
- todep: Depression score.
- tosc: Social Support Score (SCS).
- toas: Anxiety Score (AS).
## Analysis Performed
#### Viewing Data:
The initial step is to retrieve all the records from the students table to inspect the data and ensure its integrity.

#### Analysis of 'Stay' and Well-being Scores:
For students in the 'Inter' category, we analyze how their depression (todep), social support (tosc), and anxiety (toas) scores vary across different stay categories. The analysis includes:
- The count of students in each stay category.
- The average depression, social support, and anxiety scores for each stay category.
